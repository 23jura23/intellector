MoveHistory

Ncurses main menu
rewrite getTL more beautiful
Auto choice which View to update (only instanced!) - ask sokolov?
CMake instead of Make
Validate Moves in Game
constexpr instead of MACROs for colors. Make constexpr color_scheme class
colors or colours?
Controller passes turn to Game, receiving it from Game
Rename to avoid shadowing in ViewCurses constructors (warning)
size_t >= 0 (warning)
Remove trash comments
Replace unique_ptr with shared_ptr (or vice versa)
? Swap in SwapMove instead of reconstructing them
Base (for all project) exception class (IntellectorException?) but QT throws its own
Add upside-down rotate of black figures as feature
Move only in available cells when selected a figure
Decomposition
Some tiny TODOs in ViewCurses
Receive last position from Game 
Redraw Intellector: like big and small triangles, small directed down, big directed up, connected in angle point

interesting color scheme:
/*

    #define COLOR_BUTTON_SELECTED_TEXT_FOREGROUND   105
    #define COLOR_BUTTON_SELECTED_TEXT_BACKGROUND   195
    #define COLOR_BUTTON_SELECTED_EMPTY_FOREGROUND  195
    #define COLOR_BUTTON_SELECTED_EMPTY_BACKGROUND  195
    #define COLOR_BUTTON_SELECTED_BORDER_FOREGROUND 137
    #define COLOR_BUTTON_SELECTED_BORDER_BACKGROUND 137
*/  now it's SNOW_BLUE

SNOW_BLUE theme: border blends with the body by color.
Classic and snow_blue text is not constrast enough


!!! Menu further plans: multiplexer gets key, and send it to created and stored menus

Git Hooks for autoformatting
Debug and Release versions (with and without error.txt)

Install QT

Think about:
Controller template architecture model
Parallel Views at presentation (possibly, one for player, other one for bot, views from them)
